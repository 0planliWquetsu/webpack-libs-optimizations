This is the main interface of Ps3 Sfo Editor. Here you can see the fields and values of the PARAM.SFO file that you open.
 
## Step 4: Open a PARAM.SFO file
 
To open a PARAM.SFO file, you can either drag and drop it to the window, or click on File > Open and browse for it. You can find the PARAM.SFO file of your PS3 game backup in the PS3\_GAME folder on your USB drive.
 
For example, if your game backup is Gran Turismo 5, you can find its PARAM.SFO file in X:\PS3\_GAME\PARAM.SFO, where X is the letter of your USB drive.

To edit a field or value of a PARAM.SFO file, simply double-click on it and type in the new value. For example, if you want to change the game title from Gran Turismo 5 to Gran Turismo 6, just double-click on TITLE and type in Gran Turismo 6.
 
You can also add new fields or delete existing fields by right-clicking on the window and selecting Add Field or Delete Field.
 
Some fields have special meanings or functions that you should be aware of. For example:
 
- ATTRIBUTE: This field controls some features of the game, such as background music (bit 0), PSP/PSPVita remote play (bit 1), warnings (bit 4), etc. You can enable or disable these features by changing the value of this field using hexadecimal notation. For example, if you want to enable background music and remote play for your game, you should set ATTRIBUTE to 0f148eb4a0
